# COP4331 Project - VibeCity

# Product Vision

Your vision statement should contain the following information and be formatted as one or more paragraphs. This statement must be included in your main README file and not linked externally. 

1. For gen z
2. Who/That no other platform that does social media for music/ group listening
3. The product Vibe City/ Social Media/ Music
4. That leads to listen to music with your friends and do social media, find new music, rate music, music leaderboards.
5. Unlike Soundcloud, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify.
6. Our product offers in all in one place for social media for music with your friends. Real time and personal way to listen to music together with your friends while apart. (social distance music)

As a general note, it is much easier (and less risky) to use inline markdown text for any text documents you create. If you choose to use Google Docs or Google Sheets, you run the risk of providing an invalid link or linking to a file that is not properly shared. If myself or the grader cannot access your artifact, you will not receive credit for it - even if you fix the problem after it has been graded.

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

In this section, each group member needs to provide a brief description of what they worked on during the sprint. Keep this short and to the point. Your trello board and commit history will provide the details. 

**note**: For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application.

**note**: For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.

**note**: At this point I am expecting that you have designed out a few of the initial user stories and started to implement this. From this point forward there should be continuous integration and deployment, producing working software that is demoed at the end of each sprint.
